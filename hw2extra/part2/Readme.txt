All the terminal code is in bash.txt

1: I compiled the circuits and got test_js and test_cpp
2: I computed the witness and got the witness file
3: I used snarkjs to validate a proof for our input.json

at last 
I got proof.json and public.json
and I verified the proof !!!!!!!!!!!!!

so hard to set this environment QAQ.
